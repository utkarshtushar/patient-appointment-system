8. COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
------------------------------------------------------

❓ Q1: How do you prevent double booking of appointments?
💡 A1: We use Redis-based distributed locking. When a patient tries to book an appointment:
1. System acquires a lock on the specific appointment slot using Redis
2. If lock is successful, booking request goes to RabbitMQ queue
3. Consumer processes the booking within a database transaction
4. Lock is released after processing
5. If lock fails, user gets an error that slot is being processed

❓ Q2: Why did you choose asynchronous processing for appointment booking?
💡 A2: Asynchronous processing provides several benefits:
- Improved API response times (immediate acknowledgment)
- Better system reliability (message persistence in queue)
- Scalability (can handle traffic spikes)
- Fault tolerance (retry mechanisms for failures)
- Decoupling (booking and notification can scale independently)

❓ Q3: How do you handle database consistency in this distributed system?
💡 A3: We ensure consistency through:
- Database transactions for atomic operations
- Redis locking to prevent race conditions
- Message queue persistence (messages aren't lost)
- Idempotent operations (safe to retry)
- Compensating transactions for rollback scenarios

❓ Q4: Explain the notification system architecture.
💡 A4: Our notification system is designed for reliability:
1. After successful booking, notification message goes to queue
2. NotificationService processes messages asynchronously
3. Email details are persisted in NotificationQueue table
4. Background scheduler retries failed notifications
5. Status tracking (PENDING → SENT/FAILED) for monitoring

❓ Q5: How would you scale this system for 1 million users?
💡 A5: Scaling strategies:
- Horizontal scaling: Deploy multiple application instances
- Database: Read replicas, sharding by user/location
- Caching: Redis cluster for distributed caching
- Queue: RabbitMQ clustering for high availability
- CDN: Static content delivery
- Load balancer: Distribute traffic across instances
- Microservices: Split into smaller, independent services

❓ Q6: How do you ensure data security in the system?
💡 A6: Security measures implemented:
- JWT tokens with short expiration times
- Password hashing using BCrypt
- Role-based access control at endpoint level
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection
- HTTPS communication (in production)
- Sensitive data encryption
- Audit logging for security events

❓ Q7: What happens if RabbitMQ is down?
💡 A7: Fault tolerance mechanisms:
- Connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
- Fallback to synchronous processing (degraded mode)
- Health checks and monitoring for quick detection
- Message persistence ensures no data loss
- Dead letter queues for failed message handling

❓ Q8: How do you handle appointment cancellations and rescheduling?
💡 A8: Cancellation/Rescheduling flow:
1. Update appointment status to CANCELLED
2. Mark appointment slot as AVAILABLE again
3. Send cancellation notification to both parties
4. For rescheduling: Cancel existing + create new appointment
5. Handle within transactions to maintain consistency
6. Audit trail for all appointment changes

❓ Q9: Explain your testing strategy for this system.
💡 A9: Comprehensive testing approach:
- Unit tests: Service layer business logic
- Integration tests: Repository and database operations
- API tests: Controller endpoint testing
- Message queue tests: Producer-consumer testing
- Security tests: Authentication and authorization
- Performance tests: Load testing with concurrent users
- End-to-end tests: Complete booking flow testing

❓ Q10: How do you monitor the system in production?
💡 A10: Monitoring and observability:
- Application metrics: Response times, error rates
- Business metrics: Booking success rates, cancellations
- Infrastructure metrics: CPU, memory, database connections
- Log aggregation: Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Queue monitoring: Message processing rates, dead letters
- Database monitoring: Query performance, connection pools
- Email delivery tracking: Success/failure rates
- Custom dashboards: Real-time system health views
