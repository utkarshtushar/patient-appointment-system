## üìù Important Notes for Testing

### JWT Token Management
1. **Save Tokens**: Copy JWT tokens from login responses
2. **Token Expiry**: Tokens expire in 24 hours - login again if needed
3. **Token Format**: Use `Bearer <token>` in Authorization header

### API Endpoint Categories
- **Public Endpoints**: Health, Info, Home, Available Slots, Auth
- **Patient Endpoints**: Profile, My Appointments, Book Appointments
- **Doctor Endpoints**: My Appointments, Schedule Management
- **Admin Endpoints**: All Users, User Management

### Response Status Codes
- **200 OK**: Request successful
- **201 Created**: Resource created successfully  
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request data
- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid authentication
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server error

### Testing Tips
1. **Start with health check** to ensure service is running
2. **Register users first** before testing authentication
3. **Save JWT tokens** from login responses for protected endpoints
4. **Test error scenarios** to validate security
5. **Use actual IDs** from your system responses
6. **Test different user roles** to verify access control
